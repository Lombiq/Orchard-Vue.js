@* Here a demo Vue.js application will be created. As we are working with components, they need to be housed in an
   application. This application should do nothing except deliver initialization data. If your app needs to contain any
   logic or otherwise facilitate interaction between your components, then we suggest introducing a top level SFC for it
   and passing the initial data into that. *@

@* Make sure to add "@addTagHelper *, Lombiq.VueJs" to your /Views/_ViewImports.cshtml so this tag helper will work.

   Check out /Constants/ResourceNames.cs, you will see that the resource name uses kebab-case and should be the same as
   the .vue file's name without the extension. This is used to find and render the template shape.

   This tag helper renders the template as a shape (in this case "demo-sfc" becomes VueComponent-DemoShape) and injects
   the script which was tanspiled using Rollup and Bubl√© among others.

   You only need to do this for the top component(s) that you want to use in your app directly. *@
<vue-component area="@FeatureIds.Area" name="@ResourceNames.DemoSfc" />

@* This is the container of the demo app. Use binding to pass the app data into the components. *@
<div id="demoApp">
    <demo-sfc v-model="count"></demo-sfc>
</div>

@* And finally the initialization. Make sure to always use the "depends-on" attribute and include all the components
   you've injected above using the <vue-component>. *@
<script at="Foot" depends-on="@ResourceNames.DemoSfc">
    new Vue({
        el: '#demoApp',
        data: @Json.Serialize(new { Count = 10 })
    });
</script>
