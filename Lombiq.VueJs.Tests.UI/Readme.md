# Lombiq Vue.js module for Orchard Core - UI Test Extensions

## About

Extension methods that test various features in Lombiq Vue.js module for Orchard Core, with the help of [Lombiq UI Testing Toolbox for Orchard Core](https://github.com/Lombiq/UI-Testing-Toolbox).

Call these from a UI test project that also references _Lombiq.VueJs.Samples_ to verify the module's basic features; as seen in [Open-Source Orchard Core Extensions](https://github.com/Lombiq/Open-Source-Orchard-Core-Extensions).
